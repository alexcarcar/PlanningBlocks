# Planning Blocks

Planning Blocks is a simple Android app designed for brainstorming and organizing ideas using colored blocks. This intuitive tool allows you to visually structure your thoughts and plans by moving, grouping, and labeling these blocks.

## Features

*   **Create Blocks:** Easily add new colored blocks to your canvas.
*   **Move Blocks:** Drag and drop blocks to arrange them as needed.
*   **Group Blocks:** Visually cluster related ideas together.
*   **Label Blocks:** Add text labels to blocks for clarity and detail.
*   **Simple Interface:** A clean and straightforward user interface for focused brainstorming.

## Technical Stack

*   **Language:** Kotlin
*   **UI:** Jetpack Compose for a modern, declarative UI.
*   **Architecture:** [Mention your architecture, e.g., MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)]
*   **Libraries:** [List any key third-party libraries you're using, e.g., Coroutines for asynchronous operations, Room for local data persistence (if you plan to save boards)]

## Future Enhancements

*   **Saving and Loading Boards:** Allow users to save their brainstorming sessions and load them later.
*   **Customizable Block Colors:** Offer a wider palette or a color picker for blocks.
*   **Connecting Blocks:** Implement lines or arrows to show relationships between blocks.
*   **Export Options:** Allow users to export their boards as images or PDFs.
*   **Cloud Sync:** (Ambitious) Synchronize boards across multiple devices.

## How to Use

1.  **Launch the app.** You'll be greeted with a blank canvas.
2.  **Create a Block:** Tap anywhere on the empty canvas to create a new block at that position. By default, it will be assigned a random color.
3.  **Move a Block:** Press and hold on a block, then drag it to the desired location on the canvas. Release to drop it.
4.  **Label a Block:**
    *   **Method 1 (e.g., Double Tap):** Double-tap on a block to open a text input field. Type your label and confirm.
    *   **Method 2 (e.g., Long Press Menu):** Long-press on a block to bring up a context menu. Select "Edit Label" from the menu.
5.  **Group Blocks:** Simply drag blocks close to each other to visually associate them. * (If you have an actual grouping mechanism, describe it here, e.g., "Select multiple blocks by... and then tap the 'Group' button.")*
